# Tampermonkey Scripts

Hello and welcome to my Tampermonkey Scripts repository.

🌐 Making the web readable exactly the way **_you_** want it.

- **Jira Cloud Dashboards—show date fields in ydhm format**
  - From fields displaying only date (e.g. 08/13/25), get date/time from its tooltip title (e.g. Aug 13, 2025 1:23 PM) and output in ydhm format (e.g. 1d 6h 19m) — see code for more
